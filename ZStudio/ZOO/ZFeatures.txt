view formulas in excel
select cells in excel and import scenario
when a scenario is selected, populate excel with “values"
show name of scenario in excel frame titlebar, highlight/select cells in excel, maybe draw some box or frame around cells
OPERATOR Precedence
9) reference. : (colon), (single space), (comma)
8) – Negation (as in –1)
7) % Percent
6) ^ Exponentiation
5) * and / Multiplication and division
4) + and – Addition and subtraction
3) & Connects two strings of text (concatenation)
0) comparison =, < >, <=, >=, <>
parse inside out looking for operands of operators that have an alternate order equivalent
define markup to associate portions of a step with a task, this will facilitate breaking them up
create my own hyperlinks  
show halo around associated content  
look at using colors, ala excel, to delineate subtasks of a step http://www.codestructs.com/2011/11/syntax-highlighting-in-richtextbox_23.html  
error type classification
typo  
conceptual  
    use correct formula to produce results, but do not use requested method  
    use cell references in formula, but not in requested form, absolute references, copy/paste/edit instead of autofill  
    use of functions when simple formula is sufficient  
application/usage  
    right function/feature, incorrect options - omitting false expression, choosing wrong font  
    improper use of subordinate LO - malformed expression in an if statement  
    including extra cells in range  
FAIL  
    end result appears correct, but entered as value instead of formula  
    use literal values in formulas in lieu of appropriate cell references  
    any act of deception that attempts to give illusion of correct results  
weighting classifications
learning objective ranking(s)  
    major  
    minor

mark  
location  
    literal location  
    relative location  
    logical (provide rules for identifying region)  
formulas  
    literal  
    relative (use relative notation, esp. helpful in copy/paste or autofill)  
    logical (like column sum in table)  
        * this could also be associated with LO     
index
handling images
facilitate specification of “bulk” data
