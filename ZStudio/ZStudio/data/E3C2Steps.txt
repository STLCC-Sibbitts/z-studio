WizardWorks Andrew Howe owns and operates WizardWorks, an online seller of fireworks based in Franklin, Tennessee. 
Andrew wants you to help him develop an order form for his business. The form needs to contain formulas to calculate 
the charge for each order. The total charge is based on the quantity and type of items ordered plus the shipping charge 
and the 5 percent sales tax. Orders can be shipped using standard 3-to 5-day shipping for $3.99 or overnight for $10.99.
Andrew is also offering a 4 percent discount for orders that exceed $200. Both the shipping option and the discount need 
to be calculated using formulas based on values entered into the worksheet. Complete the following:

6	In cell C15, enter overnight to ship this order overnight.
7	 In cell F20, enter an IF function that tests whether the order quantity in cell E20 is greater than 0 (zero). 
If it is, return the value of cell E20 multiplied by cell D20; otherwise, return no text by entering "". 
AutoFill this formula into the range F21:F25.
8	In cell F27, calculate the sum of the values in the range F20:F25.
9	In cell F28, enter an IF function that tests whether cell F27 is greater than 200. If it is, return the value of cell F27 multiplied by the discount percentage in cell F12; otherwise, return the value 0(zero)
10	In cell F29, subtract the discount value in cell F28 from the subtotal value in cell F27
11	In cell F31, calculate the sales tax by multiplying the after discount value in cell F29 by the sales tax percentage, 0.05.

13	In cell G32, display the value of cell C15
14	In cell F34, calculate the total of the after discount value, the sales tax, and the shipping fee
