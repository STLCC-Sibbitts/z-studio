WizardWorks Andrew Howe owns and operates WizardWorks, an online seller of fireworks based in Franklin, Tennessee. 
Andrew wants you to help him develop an order form for his business. The form needs to contain formulas to calculate 
the charge for each order. The total charge is based on the quantity and type of items ordered plus the shipping charge 
and the 5 percent sales tax. Orders can be shipped using standard 3-to 5-day shipping for $3.99 or overnight for $10.99.
Andrew is also offering a 4 percent discount for orders that exceed $200. Both the shipping option and the discount need 
to be calculated using formulas based on values entered into the worksheet. Complete the following:
